		<p>1. Lialina thinks that the “user” should be thought of as a separate entity by developers when creating software. A common notion from developers is that less user interactions mean more creativity. For example, you don’t have to think about the backdoor coding you can just open up adobe and start working. The idea that programs and apps specialize features to reduce user involvement is what Lialina believes creates the invisible user and is a threat to the user’s rights. While I can agree things like coding should not be intimidating to the everyday user, I can’t agree that shortcuts and specialized software is detrimental to the future of the user experience.</p>

		<p>2. Her ideal internet user would be called a “universal user”. This idea of a universal user ties in to her belief that specialized apps or programs diminish the relationship between user and computer should not be used as a crutch. The ideal user should be able to complete all forms of tasks from sending emails to publishing and editing. Basically, a user that can complete any goal on a computer without their reliance on specialized apps no matter their skill level.</p>

		<p>3. An example of gaps being filled by users would be uploading a video on a site like. The site doesn’t do everything for the user and the gaps are when the user is required to fill in information. For example, the when uploading vimeo asks for the user to pick a file. Uploading is simple and done by the site but the presentation of the video is the user’s responsibility. Once uploaded it’s up to the user to edit information such as title, description, privacy, interactive links, distribution to other sites and the embed code.</p>
