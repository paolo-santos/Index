		<h1>READING RESPONSE 2</h1>

		<br></br>

		<p>Technology is seen as a tool that is constantly evolving and being improved upon. It is something we use every day without much thought. When Seu asks us to defamaliarize our tools, I think she wants us to think meaningfully about how we interact with technology. Technology is convenient and is usually a means to an end when attempting to complete our work or goals. Instead, Seu asks us to view the actions of technology as something just as important as the results. This way we can look deeply in how our tools can reflect art. </p>

		<p>Performing data takes existing data rearranges and presents it as a new visual piece.  Slow growth and slow death is the idea that everything that begins has to die. This is also applied to technology and websites. Early works creates meaning within human and computer interactions. I define all these works because I think reddit’s R/place doesn’t fit into any of these categories but applies a little bit of each in its experiment. Reddits R/place was an experiment in 2017 which took a blank 1000x1000 canvas and allowed users to place one pixel anywhere and in any colour every 10 minutes. This only lasted 72 hours but what took place evolved into destruction, art and advertisement. Users would band together and interact with this canvas to create symbols and art. Alternatively huge areas of space would be consumed by solid colour as users would eventually want to destroy other people’s art. This experiment takes from ‘growth and slow death’ by showcasing how a piece can evolve and change within its lifespan. This piece can work within “early works” by showing the constraints, downfalls and achievements of millions of people interacting with technology at once. This piece does not take any new data, but it does take the millions of single pixel user data taken in 72 hours and creates entire symbols and artworks.</p>
