		<h1>Website as Glass window</h1>

		<br></br>

		<p>A website could be a glass window. Glass panes are everywhere, passed by without a second thought. Invisible unless you look closely. On one side, it could be a home, shop, exhibition or nothing at all. On the other it’s people, the observers.</p>

		<p>You can put anything on your side. Some people will stop by to look inside. Most of them will just keep walking. If you look through you see whatever it is collecting dust. But if you look closer it’s a reflection of you.</p>
